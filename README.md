## Installation
Keras and Tensorflow can be heavy installations, so it is sometimes smart to
modularize the work into a virtual environment, for simple option on uninstall.
Create, Activate, and Install from within a Virtual Environment as follow:
```
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Training & Testing Deep Network Examples:
### IMDB Movie Review Classification (Binary):
Run  with:

```
python imdb.py
```

### MINST Image Digital Classification:

 ```
 python imdb.py
 ```
